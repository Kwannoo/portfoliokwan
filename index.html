                    The project in the course Complex System Simulation was about a Forest Fire Simulation. The spread of fire in a forest depends on various variables such as altitude, vegetation, wind etc. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The project was done in a group of 4 and the forest fire was simulated using Cellular Automata. I helped with implementing the model, plotting graphs, adding altitude factors and model fitting.
                    The altitude factor is based on the referenced paper and the best fitted power law in our model was the truncated power law.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Simulating the spread of forest fire important to improve our understanding and might help us in preventing future forest fires. 
                    For further research, the terrain of the simulated forest fire could be modified based on the actual terrain at hand or wider range of parameters could be used for sensitivity analysis.
                    The program was written in Python.

                    Checkers is a board game played by two players, and the objective of the game is to capture all the opponent's pieces.
                    The game involves no randomness or luck and is truely based on one's skill. However, these games can also be played by certain computer algorithms and this is exactly what my thesis was about.
                    I compared the performance of the algorithms Minimax and Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in playing the game Checkers. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In order to find out which of the two performed the best, I developed a Checkers game and implemented both algorithms for a statistical comparison.
                    I found out that the Minimax algorithm with a depth of 4 performed better than the MCTS algorithm with 500 playouts by playing a 100 matches with different openings. 
                    Users can use my program to play Checkers against or with these algorithms.

                    For further research, my program can be optimized. Usually MCTS is trained with many more playouts than 500, however due to the running time I limited my playouts to 500. Having a MCTS with more playouts might outperform Minimax.
                    Additionally statistical analysis can also be added such as t-tests, to validate the result even more.

                    The project in this course was to implement an interactive product to learn about the principles of the trajectory of designing and implementing interactive product.
                    The problem entails that these students generally put off vocabulary learning for their language classes, due to it not being that much fun. Therefore we created a game called 'Procabulary' in order to make vocabulary learning more fun and efficient for secondary students.

                    The game starts with a set amount of players selected before the game.
                    The players enter a wordlist of their choice.
                    One player will start with the bomb with a timer and has to say a word in the wordlist.
                    If the player says a word correctly, the player passes the bomb to the next player.
                    Now this player has to say a different word in the wordlist and this process repeats until the timer of the bomb runs out. 
                    When the timer runs out, the current player loses and is out for the rest of the game. The timer of the bomb resets and the process repeats.
                    The game repeats until one player is left, which is then declared the winner, or when all the words are said, which makes the remaining players winners.

                    The project was done in a group of 2. I was responsible for implementing the game, writing the code, designing the characters and making modifications in the game based on reviews of others.
                    We found that students do not necessarily learn faster playing the game compared to textbook methods, they do enjoy learning much more while playing which could result in longer study periods and therefore better results.
                    The game could be extended by adding more languages, more dynamic movement and characters, or better user interface.
                    I created the game in Unity and the script was written in C#.
